# ReSTIR BDPT

This is the official implementation for the 2025 ACM TOG paper "ReSTIR BDPT: Bidirectional ReSTIR Path Tracing with Caustics".
ReSTIR BDPT is implemented as a new pass called ReSTIRBDPT. ReSTIR BDPT specific code is found in `Source/RenderPasses/ReSTIRBDPT`.

## Running
To run, follow the Falcor build instructions below, then launch Mogwai and load the ReSTIRBDPT script in `scripts/ReSTIRBDPT.py`, then load a scene.

# Building

## Prerequisites
- Windows 10 version 20H2 (October 2020 Update) or newer, OS build revision .789 or newer
- Visual Studio 2022
- [Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0) for Windows 10, version 2004](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)
- A GPU which supports DirectX Raytracing, such as the NVIDIA Titan V or GeForce RTX
- NVIDIA driver 466.11 or newer

Optional:
- Windows 10 Graphics Tools. To run DirectX 12 applications with the debug layer enabled, you must install this. There are two ways to install it:
    - Click the Windows button and type `Optional Features`, in the window that opens click `Add a feature` and select `Graphics Tools`.
    - Download an offline package from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/windows-hardware-lab-kit#supplemental-content-for-graphics-media-and-mean-time-between-failures-mtbf-tests). Choose a ZIP file that matches the OS version you are using (not the SDK version used for building Falcor). The ZIP includes a document which explains how to install the graphics tools.
- NVAPI, CUDA, OptiX (see below)

## Building Falcor
Falcor uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system. Additional information on how to use Falcor with CMake is available in the [CMake](docs/development/cmake.md) development documetation page.

### Visual Studio
If you are working with Visual Studio 2022, you can setup a native Visual Studio solution by running `setup_vs2022.bat` after cloning this repository. The solution files are written to `build/windows-vs2022` and the binary output is located in `build/windows-vs2022/bin`.

### Visual Studio Code
If you are working with Visual Studio Code, run `setup.bat` after cloning this repository. This will setup a VS Code workspace in the `.vscode` folder with sensible defaults (only if `.vscode` does not exist yet). When opening the project folder in VS Code, it will prompt to install recommended extensions. We recommend you do, but at least make sure that _CMake Tools_ is installed. To build Falcor, you can select the configure preset by executing the _CMake: Select Configure Preset_ action (Ctrl+Shift+P). Choose the _Windows Ninja/MSVC_ preset. Then simply hit _Build_ (or press F7) to build the project. The binary output is located in `build/windows-ninja-msvc/bin`.

Warning: Do not start VS Code from _Git Bash_, it will modify the `PATH` environment variable to an incompatible format, leading to issues with CMake.

### Linux
Falcor has experimental support for Ubuntu 22.04. To build Falcor on Linux, run `setup.sh` after cloning this repository. You also need to install some system library headers using:

```
sudo apt install xorg-dev libgtk-3-dev
```

You can use the same instructions for building Falcor as described in the _Visual Studio Code_ section above, simply choose the _Linux/GCC_ preset.

### Configure Presets
Falcor uses _CMake Presets_ store in `CMakePresets.json` to provide a set of commonly used build configurations. You can get the full list of available configure presets running `cmake --list-presets`:

```
$ cmake --list-presets
Available configure presets:

  "windows-vs2022"           - Windows VS2022
  "windows-ninja-msvc"       - Windows Ninja/MSVC
  "linux-clang"              - Linux Ninja/Clang
  "linux-gcc"                - Linux Ninja/GCC
```

Use `cmake --preset <preset name>` to generate the build tree for a given preset. The build tree is written to the `build/<preset name>` folder and the binary output files are in `build/<preset name>/bin`.

An existing build tree can be compiled using `cmake --build build/<preset name>`.
